Project Checklist:

    [ALL COMPLETED] ---> Integer Expressions (30 Points)

        • [COMPLETED] ---> Integer Literals, Variables
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Variables must be declared before they are used
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Assignment Statement
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Arithmetic Operators
            • +, - [binary subtraction], *, /, %, - [unary minus]
            • ^ [exponentiation] You can assume the exponent is an expression whose value >= 0
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Relational Operators
            • <, <=, ==, >=, >, !=
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Boolean Operators
            • !, &&, ||
        • [COMPLETED] ---> All operators except ^ use the precedence and associativity rules of C. 
            ^ is right associative and has lower precedence than unary minus and higher precedence than all the other operators. 
            Parentheses are used to change order of operations.



    [ALL COMPLETED] ---> Integer I/O (30 Points)

        • [COMPLETED] ---> read[comma delimited list of variables]
            • read[x, y, z]
        • [COMPLETED] ---> print[comma delimited list of expressions]; a newline is not printed
            • print[2*x, x^3*[z*w], abc/xyz, c]
        • [COMPLETED] ---> printlines[expression]
            • printlines[2]
        • [COMPLETED] ---> printspaces[expression]
            • printspaces[3*n]



    [ALL COMPLETED] ---> Control Structures (40 Points)

        • [COMPLETED] ---> if statements including optional else
        • [COMPLETED] ---> while loops
        • [COMPLETED] ---> for loops
            • [COMPLETED] ---> Syntax similar to C but you can assume the first and third expressions are assignment statements. 
                                For example k = 1 and k = k+1
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Use C syntax and the C definition of true [non-zero] and false [zero]. 



    [ALL COMPLETED] ---> Arrays (20 Points)

        • [COMPLETED] ---> Single Dimension Arrays
            • [COMPLETED] ---> Size of the array is declared at compile time
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Use C syntax
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Subscripts must be able to use constants and expressions. 
                            For example nums[2*i] = z * nums[j-3*k]



    [PARTIALLY COMPLETED] ---> Functions (40 Points)

        • [COMPLETED] ---> void and int functions
        • [COMPLETED FOR INTEGERS, BUT ARRAYS DO NOT WORK] ---> Value parameters [the default for arrays can be pass by reference]
        • [COMPLETED] ---> Local Variables
        • [PARTIALLY COMPLETED, DOES NOT WORK WITH VALUE PARAMETERS] ---> Recursion
        • [OPTIONAL: NOT COMPLETED] ---> Reference parameters [extra 5 points



    [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Boolean Expressions (20 Points)

        • [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Boolean literals and variables
        • [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Assignment
        • [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Print [print the words true or false] and read [use 1 for true and 0 for false]
        • [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Variables must be declared before use
        • [NOT COMPLETED] ---> Boolean functions and arrays
