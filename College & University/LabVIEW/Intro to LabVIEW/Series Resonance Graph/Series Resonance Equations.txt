Series Resonance Circuit Equations

*RLC Band Pass
	Q = XL/R
	BW = fr/Q
	fr = 1/(2*(PI)*sq(L*C))
	f1 = fr - BW/2
	f2 = fr - BW/2
	Gain(dB) = 20log(Vout/Vin)
	Gain(dB) = 20log(R / sq (R^2 + (XC - XL)^2))

*RL Low Pass
	fc = R/(2*(PI)*L
	Gain(dB) = 20log(R / sq(R^2 + XL^2))
	

RL High Pass
	fc = R/(2*(PI)*L
	Gain(dB) = 20log(XL / sq(R^2 + XL^2))
	

*RC High Pass
	fc = 1/(2*(PI)*R*C
	Gain(dB) = 20log(R / sq(R^2 + XC^2))
