 	S T R I S      . . . . . . .  A Tetris-like game


D i f f e r e n c e  with other tetris games:

	- works with levels, with different widths
	- get rid of all ' yellow balls ' is enough to go to the next level

T h e   g a m e

After you launch the program, you always start at level 0. Unless you close
the application you can play the game again and again, moving up the levels
when you pass at least 3 levels in one game. For instance, if you don't get
to level 3 in your first game, you will have to restart at level 0. On the
other hand if you end at level 14, you'll be able to restart at level 12.
There are 100 levels at present.
For every level you can find a trick to pass through it. Without this tricks
you will have a hard time to pass levels.
When there are no more levels, you will get random levels instead. Of course
this means you will have to pass a hundred levels before you reach this point.

U s e d   k e y b o a r d   k e y s 

	- left/right cursor --> falling piece goes to left/right
	- up         cursor --> falling piece turns
	- down       cursor --> falling goes one position bellow previous
	- space             --> fast dropdown of falling piece

R u l e s   o f   t h e   g a m e 

As soon as all 'yellow balls' are removed from the playing field, you can
resume with the next level. When the 'Extend with balls' flag is set, new
'yellow balls' will appear as a kind of falling pieces. They can be a great
help in certain situation. They can be a terrible nuissance in other situations.

S c o r e   c o u n t i n g

Per piece	100
Per line	1000
Per level	100000 divided by the no. of lines you needed to pass through
 		       the level --> the less lines, the more points you get
Per 5 levels	50000


Good luck!
